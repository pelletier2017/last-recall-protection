# Last Recall Lock
The orb icon is clickable to lock/unlock. When locked, any teleport that would override the memory stored in your crystal of memories will be hidden.
The icon can be moved by holding alt to drag it around.

In areas that would not override your crystal of memories (such as in your house) the lock will turn yellow and 
allow teleports in that area.

Please create a github issue for any problems found with teleports that should be blocked or any other issues.
